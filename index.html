				<p>	<!-- Education -->
				
				Currently, I am pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Chemical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.
					
				</p>	
				<p>	<!-- Interests -->
				I love Math, for its sheer purity and beauty. I believe it is the foundation to the universe as we know it.
				I love coding, and problem-solving in general. Recently, I dabbled into the field of Deep Learning, and the experience was amazing. You can have a look at my projects and other activities <a href="#activities">here</a>. 
				<br>
				I like to learn, be it new technologies, subjects or ideas. Nothing gives me more satisfaction than learning and mastering a new skill.
				</p>
				<p>	<!-- hobbies -->
				I am an avid sports enthusiast, and follow a plethora of sports. I am a part of the aquatics team of IIT Bombay, and swim almost everyday of the week. Swimming is the most complete form of exercise out there, and apart from the obvious physical benefits, I believe it also helps me focus better. I am a Manchester United fan (GGMU) and love playing and watching football.
				<br>
				I am also into meditation and mindfulness. I believe mastering our thoughts and emotions is the key to leading a happy life, something that is achievable through meditation.
