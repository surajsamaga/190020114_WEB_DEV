							<p style= "font-family:Roboto ; font-size: 26px;" ><b> Hey there! I am Suraj Samaga! </b></p> 
							<p class="paras"> I am a Sophomore of the <strong>Chemical Engineering Department</strong> in the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.
							<br> I am an enthusiastic, self-driven individual with a thirst to make a difference.  
							I believe that process of learning is eternal, and love to discover new technologies, subjects or ideas. 
							</p>
							<h3 class="para_headings"> Interests </h3>
							<p class="paras">	I love coding, and <strong>problem solving</strong> in general. The thrill of imagining something in your head and realizing it straight with your hands is something that I cherish.
						<br> Math is another topic that I am very passionate about, for its elegance and very diverse applications. In particular, I find Calculus and Linear Algebra extremely interesting.   
						<br> Recently, I dabbled into the field of <strong>Deep Learning</strong>, and the experience was amazing. Have a look at some of my projects <a href="#activities">here</a>. 
							</p>
							<h3 class="para_headings"> Hobbies </h3>
							<p class="paras">
							Being a part of the Aquatics team of IIT Bombay, I swim almost everyday of the week. Swimming is the most complete form of exercise out there, and apart from the obvious physical benefits, I believe it also helps me focus better. <br>I am also a Manchester United fan (GGMU) and love playing and watching football.
				<br>
				Meditation is a part of my daily routine, as I believe that mastering our thoughts and emotions is the key to leading a happy life.
